# Bias of Link Prediction Methods 
This repo contains the code and data to study the bias of link prediction methods. 

You find the data in `data/` 
In the `models/` part you find the code for the Link Prediction methods, in `diffusion` the code for the
diffusion centrality measures. 
Lastly, the scripts or notebooks for the experiments will be in `experiments/`

*This structure probably will change*
